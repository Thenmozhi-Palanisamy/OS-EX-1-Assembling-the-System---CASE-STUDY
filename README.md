Ex:Assembling the system

## AIM:
To assemble the system.

## MATERIALS REQUIRED :

1.Computer case.
2. CPU.
3.RAM.
4.Thermal kit.
5.MotherBoard.

## Procedure:

1.Prepare your workspace: 

*Choose a clean, well-lit, and static-free area to work in. Place the motherboard on a non-conductive surface like its *anti-static bag.

2.Install the CPU (Central Processing Unit): 

* Open the CPU socket on the motherboard
UAlign the CPU with the socket, ensuring the notches match.
*Gently place the CPU into the socket without applying any force.

3.Install the CPU Cooler: Attach the CPU cooler according to the manufacturer's instructions.

* Apply thermal paste to the CPU
(if not pre-applied on the cooler).
* Attach the CPU cooler according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
* Connect the cooler's fan to the CPU
fan header on the motherboard.

4.Install RAM (Random Access Memory): Align the notch on the RAM stick with the slot on the motherboard.

* Open the RAM slots on
the motherboard.
* Align the notch on the RAM stick
with the slot on the motherboard.
* Press down evenly on both ends of
the RAM stick until it clicks into place.

5.Install the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit): Align the GPU with the PCIe slot on the motherboard.

* If your CPU has integrated graphics, this
step may be unnecessary.
* Align the GPU with the PCIe slot
on the motherboard.
* Push down gently until it clicks into
place.
* Secure the GPU with screws to the case (if
required).
